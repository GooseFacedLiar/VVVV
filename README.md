# Vocal Volume Voracity Viewfinder (4V)
## What Problem Does This Solve?
Loudness of voice among households.
## Who Needs This?
Me, and others with voice modulation issues.

The 4V is a Stoplight with 3 modes. Acceptable, A bit loud, and too loud, (All mapped to the Green, Yellow and Red lights.)
It will require:

A python library to listen for audio
A library for Python to communicate with an arduino
Arduino code to change color based on volume thresholds set by user
Arduino
3 LED Lights
A box
Wires
Breadboard
